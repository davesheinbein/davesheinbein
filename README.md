## Recommendations

**Chris Drottar**  
_Acting VP of Software Engineering, Health SMB/DF at
Internet Brands_  
"David is an excellent team member. Working as a part of my
Front End Engineering team, David has proved to be
adaptable, dedicated, dependable, with a growing confidence,
and expending skill set. Through the years that I have
worked with him so far, he has taken on tasks that vary on
the difficulty spectrum and solved them all. David is
frequently looking for the best way to solve a problem and
delivering on time and within estimates. David was flexible
enough to work with an EOL version of Angular and new react
frameworks at the same building each in different
simultaneous projects. His time and attention management is
excellent. More recently he has begun leading milestone
demonstrations intended for management and assisting peers
coming into the codebases. David has always been a strong
performer, and if given the chance in the future I would
certainly recommend his hire."

**Budi Chandra**  
_Sr. Web Developer at Internet Brands_  
"David plays an important role in our frontend development
team. He has grown from an associate to a well-established
frontend developer, displaying quick wit, passion for his
work, and excellent communication skills to keep projects
moving forward."

**Ashwini Bauskar**  
_Executive Technology Director, Program Management & Agile
Leadership_  
"Working with David has been a great experience.
Histechnical skills and creativity made him a valuable part
ofour team. He effectively translated front-end
requirementsinto streamlined systems and enhanced dynamic
forms usingReact, Angular, and CSS. I was especially

**Terence Kulik**  
_Director of Technology at Internet Brands_  
"My team was primarily backend developers, but we would
regularly borrow David in order to build react bundles for
our projects. David was a highly skilled front end
developer, who was a pleasure to work with. We could give
him a design in figma or any other tool and he could create
a pixel perfect implementation. If he had any concerns or
questions, he would raise them immediately and proactively.
If I had the opportunity, I would absolutely work with David
again."

**Zohreh Malek**  
_Sr. Technical Program/Project Manager_

developers on my team over the past few years. He
consistently demonstrated meticulous attention to detail, a

#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) projects to create
  interactive 3D web experiences.

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

- Advanced [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) techniques and
  exploring WebGL for enhanced graphics performance.

#### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to:

- Collaborate on innovative coding projects, particularly
  those involving front-end development and interactive web
  applications.

#### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for:

- Full-time opportunities and freelance projects where I can
  contribute my skills in front-end development,
  particularly with React and Three.js.

#### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:

1. What inspired you to pursue a career in front-end
   development?

   - Iâ€™ve always enjoyed blending creativity with
     functionality, and front-end development lets me bring
     designs to life while enhancing user experience.
     Working with brands like WebMD showed me the impact of
     a well-designed interface on usability.

2. How did you get started with React?

   - I started coding with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in
     college while earning my media production degree,
     exploring AR/VR projects with Unity and related
     programs. After college, I built various websites as a
     digital marketer, honing my skills in creating fast,
     effective sites for clients seeking crowdfunding. My
     interest in interactive development led me to React
     during my General Assembly program, and after that, I
     moved on to work at SuperWorld and then Internet
     Brands, where I further developed my skills.

3. What are some of your favorite features of React?

   - I love Reactâ€™s component-based architecture for its
     reusability, as well as its virtual DOM and hooks like
     `useState` and `useEffect` for managing dynamic,
     efficient updates.

4. Can you describe a challenging project you worked on
   using React?

   - A challenging project was creating a custom UI modal
     triggered by a Font Awesome icon at Internet Brands. It
     required precise design integration and optimizing for
     high performance across interconnected components.

5. How do you stay updated with the latest trends and
   updates in front-end development?
   - I stay current by reading articles, following top
     GitHub projects, and building personal projects to try
     out new tools. Recently, Iâ€™ve been exploring React
     Native to expand my skills into mobile development.
