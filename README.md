**Ashwini Bauskar**  
*Executive Technology Director, Program Management & Agile Leadership*  
"Working with David has been a great experience. His technical skills and creativity made him a valuable part of our team. He effectively translated front-end requirements into streamlined systems and enhanced dynamic forms using React, Angular, and CSS. I was especially impressed by his work on the HOP UI Kit, which showcased his commitment to both quality and innovation. David also communicated effectively with the product team, consistently reviewing designs, identifying gaps, and proposing alternative technical solutions to help define use cases in more detail. He was always ready to help any team member for onboarding or for new project work, making him a great team player. His strong teamwork and collaboration helped make our project a success."

**Terence Kulik**  
*Director of Technology at Internet Brands*  
"My team was primarily backend developers, but we would regularly borrow David in order to build React bundles for our projects. David was a highly skilled front-end developer, who was a pleasure to work with. We could give him a design in Figma or any other tool, and he could create a pixel-perfect implementation. If he had any concerns or questions, he would raise them immediately and proactively. If I had the opportunity, I would absolutely work with David again."

**Zohreh Malek**  
*Sr. Technical Program/Project Manager*  
"David has collaborated closely with all of the front-end developers on my team over the past few years. He consistently demonstrated meticulous attention to detail, a clear design vision, and an ability to identify gaps in the process, proactively communicating them to the product team. I was highly impressed with his work and would confidently recommend him for any front-end development position."

**Deepika Chaudhari**  
*Senior Frontend Developer at Internet Brands*  
"I had the honor of working with David at Internet Brands, where he was instrumental in bringing our complex healthcare web apps to life. A solid, effective frontend dev with a crisp sense for building the right solutions at the right time, he works efficiently and autonomously. Any problem we could think of, I was confident that David would be able to find a solution. While his skills in frontend technologies like React and Angular are great, what makes him a standout teammate is his ability to break down complex problems into manageable pieces and his attention to detail."
